ABSTRACT

There  is  a  substantial  amount  of  research  studies  today  emphasizing  the  need  to  provide  self-directed  learners  with
methodological and psychological support, to help them develop the necessary skills to direct their learning approach as
well as positive attitudes and self-awareness towards language learning.  Both types of preparation are thought to be
essential to help learners become more autonomous and ultimately, more successful language learners. Yet, whereas a
great many of these studies illustrate applications of learner’s methodological support, namely, in the form of strategic
training, or helping learners elicit their goals and devise their own learning plans, little is reported as to how the learner’s
psychological preparation is undertaken.  With very few exceptions, there are not many studies that have reported how
students'  attitudes  and  beliefs  towards  language  learning,  also  known  as  metacognitive  knowledge,  are  dealt  with  in
self-directed learning programs.  The objective of this paper is therefore twofold: a) provide a review of studies that have
used different data elicitation instruments and procedures for eliciting and fostering learners’ metacognitive knowledge;
and  b)  describe  the  weaknesses  and  strengths  of  those  procedures  as  analyzed  by  research  studies,  which  should
allow us to establish objective criteria for how and when to use them in self-directed learning programs.

RESUM

Són  molts  els  estudis  que  avui  en  dia  incideixen  en  la  necessitat  d’oferir  un  suport  metodològic  i  psicològic  als
aprenents que treballen de manera autònoma. L’objectiu d’aquest suport és ajudar-los  a desenvolupar les destreses
que necessiten per dirigir el seu aprenentatge així com una actitud positiva i una major conscienciació envers aquest
aprenentatge.  En  definitiva,  aquests  dos  tipus  de  preparació  es  consideren  essencials  per  ajudar  els  aprenents  a
esdevenir més autònoms i més eficients en el seu propi aprenentatge. Malgrat això, si bé és freqüent trobar estudis que
exemplifiquen aplicacions del suport metodològic dins els seus programes, principalment en la formació d’estratègies o
ajudant  els  aprenents  a  desenvolupar  un  pla  de  treball,  aquest  no  és  el  cas  quan  es  tracta  de  la  seva  preparació
psicològica. Amb rares excepcions, trobem estudis que documentin com s’incideix en les actituds i en les creences dels
aprenents,  també  coneguts  com  a  coneixement  metacognitiu  (CM),  en  programes  que  fomenten  l’autonomia  en
l’aprenentatge.  Els objectius d’aquest treball son dos: a) oferir una revisió d’estudis que han utilitzat diferents mitjans
per incidir en el CM dels aprenents i b) descriure les febleses i avantatges dels procediments i instruments que utilitzen,
tal  com  han  estat  valorats  en  estudis  de  recerca,  ja  que  ens  permetrà  establir  criteris  objectius  sobre  com  i  quan
utilitzar-los en programes que fomentin l’aprenentatge autodirigit.

RESUMEN

Hoy en día son muchos los estudios que inciden en la necesidad de ofrecer un apoyo metodológico y psicológico a los
estudiantes que aprenden de manera autónoma. El objetivo de esta preparación  es el de ayudarlos a desarrollar las
habilidades que necesitan para dirigir su aprendizaje así como una actitud positiva y una mayor concienciación hacia
este aprendizaje. En definitiva, estos dos tipos de preparación se consideran esenciales para ayudar a los estudiantes
a ser mas autónomos y mas eficaces en  su propio aprendizaje. Sin embargo,  si bien es frecuente encontrar estudios
que  ejemplifican  aplicaciones  del  apoyo  metodológico  que  ofrecen  dentro  de  sus  programas,  principalmente  en  la
formación de estrategias o ayudando a los aprendices a desarrollar un plan de trabajo, este no es el caso cuando se
trata de su preparación psicológica. Excepcionalmente encontramos estudios que documenten como se incide en las
actitudes  y  en  las  creencias  de  los  estudiantes,  también  conocidas  como  conocimiento  metacognitivo  (CM),  en
programas que fomentan la autonomía de los estudiantes.  Los objetivos del presente trabajo son dos: a) ofrecer una
revisión de estudios que han utilizado diferentes procedimientos e instrumentos para incidir en el CM de los aprendices,
y  b)  describir  los  puntos  débiles  y  las  ventajas  de  dichos  procedimientos,  tal  como  se  han  valorado  en  estudios  de
investigación, ya que nos va a permitir establecer criterios objetivos sobre cómo y cuando utilizarlos en programas que
fomenten el aprendizaje auto-dirigido.

1.  INTRODUCTION:  LEARNER  TRAINING  IN  SELF-DIRECTED  LEARNING
PROGRAMS

Developing learners’ autonomy has become an important goal for many educational institutions
and  today  we  can  find  many  contexts  such  as  classrooms,  self-access  centers,  or  distance
learning  programs  that  encourage  learners  to  develop  a  more  autonomous  or  self-directed
learning approach (henceforth referred to as SDL). Yet, only "providing learners with self-access
facilities  can  not  guarantee  a  full  and  efficient  use  of  those  facilities"  (Sheerin,  1989:  34),  nor
can  it  ensure  the  successful  development  of  learners'  autonomy.    Hence,  what  most  studies
today suggest is that self-directed learners should be provided with some kind of learner training
support  that  can  help  them  develop  their  knowledge  and  executive  skills  to  manage,  monitor
and evaluate their own learning.

There  are  several  justifications  for  this  need  (Victori,  2004).  First  of  all,  there  seems  to  be  a
natural  resistance  on  the  part  of  many  learners  to  become  autonomous.  This  fact  should  not
surprise us if we bear in mind that their educational backgrounds are usually grounded on very
traditional  teaching  methodologies,  in  which  the  whole  curriculum  was  entirely  determined  by
the teacher or the school. Thus, when they are encouraged to direct their own learning, learners
are faced with two types of problems: a)  most of them lack the methodological preparation to
organize their own learning, and very often they end up undertaking activities without any sound
learning plan behind them; and b) most believe they are not skilled or confident enough to adopt
such a responsibility, which often leads them to develop a negative attitude towards adopting a
SDL approach.

Particularly  in  the case of self-access centers, it has  also  been  noted  that  they  often  become
underused as learners may not be aware of the potential uses of the center’s resources, or else,
because they only use those resources that are more familiar or appear more attractive to them.
Some learners eventually get tired of using the same resources and many drop out of the SDL
program.  Hence, providing learners with support systems or with some form of learner training
is  a  good  way  of  addressing  many  of  these  problems  and  of  helping  learners  become  more
expert, more efficient and ultimately, more autonomous learners.

According to research (Holec, 1981; Dickinson, 1987), this support should involve two types of
preparation:  methodological  and  psychological.  The  methodological  preparation  is  intended  to
help  learners  plan,  monitor  and  evaluate  their  learning.  To  do  so,  learners  are  often  helped
identify their language needs, pedagogical objectives and specific activities which should allow
them  to  draw  an  individualized  learning  plan.  Very  often,  this  preparation  also  includes  some
form  of  strategic  training  addressed  to  improve  their  repertoire  of  learner  strategies.  The
psychological  preparation,  on  the  other  hand,  is  intended  to  deal  with  the  learners'  attitudes,
feelings  and  beliefs  about  language  learning  and  self-directed  learning.  Both  types  of
preparation  are  essential  and  need  to  be  provided  together  as  part  of  the  learner’s  natural
development towards autonomy.

However, up until recently this preparation was clearly imbalanced. For many programs learner
training  was  simply  reduced  and  limited  to  the  methodological  preparation,  that  is,  at  the
behavioral  level,  overlooking  the  important  role  of  the  psychological  support.  They  tended  to
focus exclusively on the teaching of strategies or on other technicalities such as filling in needs
analysis and evaluation forms, language learning contracts and students’ logs, without providing
the necessary psychological support that should accompany  it. The results  obtained  were  not
always  as  good  as  expected.  For  example,  some  students  were  observed  to  remain
unsuccessful  after  being  instructed  in  the  so-called  effective  strategies;  other  learners
discontinued  their  attendance  in  SDL  programs  and  a  great  number  of  them  showed  a
persistent  resistance  to  accept  responsibility  for  their  own  learning  and  thus  to  adopt  a  more
autonomous approach.

Among  the  possible  reasons  for  these  unsuccessful  attempts  of  learner  training  it  was
suggested that the students’ own knowledge and expectations that that they brought to the task,
known as Metacognitive knowledge, had been ignored. This knowledge is believed to interfere
with  the  students’  attitude  and  learning  approach,  and  in  turn,  with  the  entire  learner  training

program.  For  example,  some  students  appear  to  develop  misconceptions  about  language
learning about the nature of learning, their problems, task requirements, strategies, etc.  which
may  become  counterproductive  for  their  own  learning,  as  they  use  strategies  inappropriately,
avoid the use of certain activities, or develop anxiety to the point of giving up any attempts of
learning a second language (Brown, 1987; Wenden, 1987).

As  a  result,  in  recent  years  we  have  started  to  witness  in  many  of  these  SDL  programs  an
increasing awareness of the need to deal with the learners’ metacognition as well, and a few of
them have  already incorporated  this  element  as  part  of  the  learner  training  support  they  offer
(see Rubin,1999 for a recent review of practical applications). This paper intends to  provide a
revision  of  these  programs.    Two  particular  objectives  are  pursued:  a)  to  provide  a  review  of
studies that that have used different data elicitation instruments and procedures for eliciting and
fostering learners’ metacognitive knowledge; and b) describe the weaknesses and strengths of
those procedures as analyzed by research studies, which should allow us to establish objective
criteria for how and when to use them in self-directed learning programs.

2. METACOGNITIVE KNOWLEDGE ABOUT LANGUAGE LEARNING

Metacognitive  knowledge  refers  to  the  individual's  beliefs  about  oneself  and  about  others  as
learners and of the requirements involved in the learning process (Flavell, 1979).  Examples of
metacognitive knowledge may be the belief, that one  is good  at listening comprehension; that
one has to be intelligent to learn a language; that learning English is more difficult than learning
other languages or that memory strategies are more appropriate for learning vocabulary (Victori,
1992).

Different categories have been attributed to metacognitive knowledge and, as a result, various
taxonomies  exist.  One  of  the  first  classifications,  often  referred  to  by  researchers,  is  the  one
provided by Flavell (1979; 1981a; 1981b).   He distinguishes three types of knowledge: person,
task  and  strategic.

includes 

Person  knowledge  refers  to  the  beliefs  one  has  about  oneself  and  others  as  cognitive
processors  (learners).  Flavell 
intraindividual  differences  and
interindividual differences (knowledge of personal styles, abilities, and so forth, of oneself and of
others);  and  universals  of  cognition  (knowledge  of  human  attributes  influencing  learning).
Examples of these subcategories, applied to L2 learning, would be the beliefs that you can learn
better  by  memorizing;  that  your  classmates  are  better  language  learners  than  you;  and  that
factors  such  as  motivation,  intelligence,  and  so  forth,  play  an  important  role  in  language
learning.

two  dimensions: 

Task knowledge refers to the knowledge that learners have about the information or resources
needed  for  undertaking  certain  tasks  and  about  the  degree  of  effort  required  and  difficulty
involved in performing them. This knowledge entails four aspects (Wenden, 1991): knowledge
about a) the purpose of a task (what is the objective in performing a given task?); b) about task
demands  (what  resources  and  steps  are  necessary  and  what  is  the  degree  of  difficulty
involved?); c) about the nature of the task (what kind of learning is it?); and d) awareness of the
need  for  deliberate  learning  (Does  it  involve  the  use  of  self-regulatory  or  metacognitive
strategies?).  Examples  would  be  the  belief  that  it  is  easier  to  recognize  things  than  to  recall
them; that reading comprehension is facilitated when the content is familiar and organized, and
that in listening comprehension, one does not have to understand every single word. As pointed
out  by  Wenden  (1987),  metalinguistic  awareness  would  be  also  contained  within  task
knowledge.

Strategic knowledge refers to knowledge concerning what strategies are likely to be effective in
achieving  certain  goals  and  undertaking  certain  tasks.  This  category,  as  further  developed  by
Wenden  (1987),  includes:  knowledge  about  strategy  and 
the
effectiveness of certain strategies; and knowledge about the principles underlying the choice of
strategy.  This  last  aspect  has  been  referred  to  by  other  authors  (Schmitt  &  Newby,  1986)  as
conditional knowledge, that is, knowing when and why to apply a strategy. Some examples of
strategy knowledge would be the belief that, in order to memorize lists of unrelated words it is

best to form mental associations among the words; or that in looking for specific information in a
reading passage, you do not have to read through all of it.
Several  are  the  features  that  have  been  attributed  in  the  literature  to  this  type  of  knowledge.
One of the general assumptions made is that metacognitive knowledge is stable, as part of our
stored knowledge (Brown & Palinscar, 1982) and that it is "not different from other knowledge
stored in long-term memory" (Flavell, 1979:907).  A second feature is the possibility of its being
fallible,  that  is,  not  always  accurate  in  nature.    Thus,  there  are  many  beliefs  about  second
language  learning  commonly  held  but  which  are  not  supported  empirically.  Another  feature
ascribed  to  metacognitive  knowledge  is  that  it  is  interactive,  i.e.,  it  can  influence  the  learner's
approach  towards  language  learning  and  vice  versa.  Finally,  Metacognitive  knowledge,
according to Flavell, is also statable, that is, available to awareness "...which can be activated
as a result of a deliberate, conscious memory search, or unintentionally, by retrieval cues in the
task situation" (Flavell, 1979: 907).

Acknowledging these features is important for the significant implications that derive from them,
both, for language  learning  and  for  undertaking  research  in  this  field.  First  of  all,  the  fact  that
some  of  these  beliefs  may  be  fallible  implies  that  some  students  may  approach  language
learning    with  a  number  of  misconceptions  about  language  learning  that  may  not  match
teachers’ approaches and researchers’ theories about SLA learning and teaching (Victori, 1992;
Flavell, 1979).  On the other hand, being interactive  with  one’s learning  approach  implies that
some  of  these  misconceptions  may  seriously  interfere  with  the  learners’  own  approach  to
learning.  Hence, the need to elicit this knowledge and deal with it in SDL programs.  Finally, the
idea that MK is also said to be statable has generated a lot of controversy among researchers
(Rowe, 1988; Jacobs & Paris, 1987), who question whether metacognition is always accessible
to an individual's awareness.  Whereas no general agreement exists concerning this dichotomy,
some  researchers  support  both  possibilities,  depending  on  the  task  undertaken  and  on  the
proficiency  of  the  learner.  Thus,  metacognitive  awareness  is  most  likely  to  occur  when  a
problem  arises  (e.g.,  you  realize  you  are  not  progressing),  or  when  you  undertake  a  novel
situation, which requires conscious thinking (Flavell, 1981a). On the other hand, when you can
achieve  your goals  without effort, i.e.,  when  the  task  is  easy  and  known,  or  when  you  are  an
expert learner, metacognitive knowledge may remain inaccessible to conscious awareness, due
to the resulting automaticity of the cognitive skill (Schmitt & Newby, 1981).

Hence,  whether  metacognition  is  conscious  or  not  has  important  implications  for  research
procedures  since  it  raises  doubts  as  to  whether  one  can  accept  the  methods  for  assessing
metacognitive knowledge, such as self-reports, questionnaires, verbal protocols and interviews
as valid. That is, do the data obtained through these instruments actually represent the subjects'
metacognition?  In  order  to  counteract  some  of  these  problems,  it  has  been  suggested  that
interpretation of results always be offered with caution and that researchers use more than one
method for collecting data on learners’ beliefs.

3.  ENHANCING  METACOGNITIVE  KNOLWEDGE 
LEARNING PROGRAMS

IN  SELF-DIRECTED

The increasing awareness of many self-directed learning  programs to deal  with their learners’
MK  as  part  of  the  support  provided  has  resulted  in  a  variety  of  exploratory  procedures  for
eliciting and enhancing this type of data. The means to elicit  or deal  with MK knowledge may
vary  from  one  program  to  another,  and  very  much  it  depends  on  the  particular  social,
economical and pedagogical circumstances of the program or self-access center, i.e., whether
the  center  or  program  has  qualified  counselors  /  teachers  (henceforth  referred  to  as
pedagogues) to  undertake this task; whether  this  training  is  offered  to  students  individually  or
else to entire groups; whether there are financial resources to support this training, etc.  All of
these factors will  determine  whether MK is  enhanced  under  the  guidance  of  a  pedagogue,  or
else  whether  this  is  left  to  the  student  her/himself  with  the  help  of  some  learner  training
materials.    In  the  former  situation,  this  activity  can  be  undertaken  through  group  sessions  or
individually, in counseling sessions. A combination of these different options, individually and in
groups, with or without a pedagogue is also possible.  In what follows we will illustrate some of
the most typical procedures and instruments used in each case:

1. 

Individual  sessions:  Counseling  sessions  have  become  a  customary  practice  in  many
SAC’s or in some SDL programs (see Mozzon-McPherson & Vismans, 2001 for several
illustrations of counseling). These tend to be held individually between the learner and
the  counselor  and  may  serve  a  number  of  purposes:  initially  to  help  the  learner
diagnose  his  own  needs  and  pedagogical  objectives  which  are  used  as  the  basis  for
drawing  an  individual  learning  plan  or  contract.  Later,  these  sessions  are  useful  to
check  students’  progress,  to  provide  them  with  feedback  on  their  productive  skills,  to
give them advice on  their general language learning approach,  and  above  all,  to  deal
with the learners’ problems, doubts and language learning beliefs and misconceptions.
Therefore,  because  of  the  nature  of  the  topics  dealt  with  in  these  interactions,  these
sessions offer manifold opportunities to elicit, contrast, or enhance the learners’ MK.  As
a  matter  of  fact,  these  sessions  are  often  referred  to  as  'conversations'…  that  help
students  reflect  on  their  own  learning  experience  (Esch,  1996  -  cited  in  Mozzon-
McPherson  &  Vismans,  2001:13),  which  already  shows  their  instrumental  role  in
enhancing  learners'  awareness  about  language  learning.    Apart  from  carrying  on
spontaneous conversations with the learners, the counselor may deliberately decide to
use  other  resources  to  deal  with  this  area  more  explicitly,  such  as  formal  interviews,
written  questionnaires,  dialogue  journals,  reading  passages  on  SLA  topics,  or  other
learner training materials (see below).

2.  Group  sessions.    In  classroom-based  SDL  programs,  group  sessions  are  clearly  the
most  typical  procedure  used  for  dealing  with  the  learners’  MK.  But  these  are
increasingly  also  being  offered  in  some  self-access  centers,  which  hold  induction
sessions to introduce new users not only to the facilities and resources of the center but
to SDL as well (see Pemberton & Toogood, 2001; Nordlund, 2001; Or, 1994, for some
examples).  Depending on the center, this introduction may last anywhere from one to
several  weeks  or  may  be  undertaken  throughout  the  whole  program  in  the  form  of
workshops, seminars or group tutorials. In those sessions a number of raise-awareness
activities are  often  undertaken  on  various  aspects  related  to  L2  learning,  self-directed
learning and themselves as learners. To this end, they may use several  resources and
procedures,  such  as  written  questionnaires  and  forms,  self-rating  scales,  group
interviews,  raise-awareness  tasks,  simulations,  etc.,  which  serve  as  a  stimulus  for
subsequent  group  discussions.  Besides  their  important  role  in  supporting  learners
methodologically  and  psychologically,  group  sessions  also  serve  the  purpose  of
increasing the opportunities of interaction among learners and adding a social element
to the so often denounced isolation that SDL usually involves.

3.  Learner training materials.  These materials usually  include tasks, forms or guidelines
that  are  meant  to  raise  the  learner’s  awareness  on  their  language  learning  approach
and to suggest ways of improving it.   Because they are meant to be used for self-study
purposes, special care has to be taken in writing the instructions, objectives and tasks
provided which have to be transparent enough to be used successfully without teacher
or counselor intervention. Furthermore, they should be reflective and thought-provoking
to ensure the learners’ MK is enhanced. Many of these materials also offer suggestions
and recommendations at  the  end of the task which may be useful for contrasting and
enlightening learners’ own assumptions and possible misconceptions.  These materials
may range from in-house made worksheets, handbooks, guidelines to self-administered
questionnaires and forms, and may be used individually or in groups (see Lynch, 2000;
Lamb, 1996, and Nunan, 1997, for examples of how materials have  been adapted for
SDL  purposes,  and  Ellis  &  Sinclair,  1989,  for  examples  of  tasks  that  can  be  used  for
learner training materials).

A  revision  of  the  studies  analyzed  so  far  suggests  that  self-directed  learning  programs  use  a
variety of instruments for eliciting learners' MK  that may range from very structured formats to
more open-ended ones, as they appear summarized in what follows:

1.  Structured procedures, which provide a limited number or pre-established answers for
ranking-scale

to  choose,  such  as  Lickert-scale,  multiple-choice, 

respondents 

Documents de Recerca ª

questionnaires, standardized interviews, as well as some structured SDL learning forms
and guidelines.

2.  Semi-structured  procedures,  which  have  a  specific  set  of  semi-open  questions
determined in advance but which allow elaboration in the questions and answers, such
as semi-open questionnaires and interviews, semi structured SDL forms, students' logs,
autobiographies, and some raise-awareness tasks.

3.  Open  procedures,  which  use  open  questions  that  allow  the  respondents  to  answer  at
length, using their own words and elaborating on the issues raised, such as interviews,
counseling  sessions,  simulations  and  scenarios,  group  discussion  or  tutorials,  diaries
and some raise-awareness tasks.

All  of  these  types  of  procedures  have  advantages  and  disadvantages  that  need  to  be
considered before adopting them for use. Among others, we have to decide what our purpose
is, whether to explore learners’ beliefs at length or simply describe them; what kind of data we
want  to  obtain  (qualitative  or  quantitative)  and  how  we  want  to  analyze  it,  and  how  many
learners we want to work with, as all these decisions will determine which type of instrument we
use. In the two tables which appear below, some of the general advantages and disadvantages
associated  with the use  of structured and unstructured  instruments for  research  purposes  are
presented (Brown, 2001):

4.    A  REVIEW  OF  THE  PROCEDURES  AND  INSTRUMENTS  USED  TO
ELICIT MK

In this  section  we  will  exemplify  how  these  different  procedures  have  been  applied  in  various
SDL  programs.  Far  from  providing  an  exhaustive  list  with  all  of  the  studies  that  have  been
undertaken, this section is intended to illustrate instances of the most common practices and to
pinpoint,  based  on  different  research  study  findings,  the  advantages  and  main  problems
associated with their use for eliciting data on the learner's metacognitive knowledge.

4.1 Questionnaires

Questionnaires are by far the most popular procedure used in the studies examined for eliciting
learners’  metacognitive  knowledge.  Among  them  structured  questionnaires  clearly  outnumber
the  use  of  more  open-ended  instruments,  as  they  are  easier  to  administer  and  may  be  used
with  a  larger  number  of  learners  simultaneously.    Within  structured  instruments,  Lickert-scale
questionnaires  are  generally  preferred  to  other  types,  such  as  those  composed  of  multiple
choice, semantic differential or ranking scales questions.

Perhaps the most widely known instrument used for eliciting learners’ general beliefs about L2
learning  is  BALLI,  a  34-item  questionnaire  developed  by  Horwitz  (1985)  which  examines
learners’  beliefs  in  five  major  areas:  foreign  language  aptitude,  the  difficulty  of  language
learning;  the  nature  of  language  learning,  motivations  and  strategies.  This  pioneering
questionnaire  deserves special attention as it set the ground for subsequent research studies
that also used structured instruments to analyze different dimensions of students’ beliefs.  For
example,  Sakui  and  Gaies  (1999)  looked  into  the  learning  beliefs  of  1300  Japanese  learners
about  their  orientation  towards  learning  English  and  their  perceived  quality  and  sufficiency  of
classroom instruction; Mory (1999) contrasted students’ epistemological beliefs with L2 learning
beliefs; Cotteral (1999)  elicited beliefs of 139 subjects on  different dimensions:  the  role  of  the
teacher, the role of  feedback; the learner’s sense of self-efficacy; strategic knowledge, and  the
nature  of  language  learning;  Victori  (1992)  examined  the  beliefs  of  ESL  and  EFL  students
(Victori  &  Lockhart,  1995)  following  Flavell's  three  types  of  MK:  person,  task  and  strategic
knowledge; Willing’s questionnaire (1988) was designed to elicit students’ learning preferences;
Littlewood’s  (2000)    to  examine  how  cultural  beliefs  may  bias  SDL  programs,  and  Tumposky
(1991,  cited  in  Richards  &  Lockhart,  1994),  to  analyze  the  differences  between  the  belief
systems of Soviet and American students.

Among the three types of MK described in section 2, strategic knowledge seems to be the area
that  has  received  the  greatest  attention.  The  Strategy  Inventory  of  Language  Learning  (SILL)
designed  by  Oxford  (1990)  (see  Oxford  &  Burry-Stock,  1995,  for  a  full  review  of  studies  that
have used it) stands out as one of the most frequently cited  instruments used in L2 language
studies, which assesses students’ reported use of metacognitive, cognitive, social, and affective
strategies.  Similar instruments are those described by Sheorey  and  Mokhtari  (2001),  Politzer
and  McGroarty  (1985),  Dörnyei  and  Lee  (1997),  among  others.    Less  frequently  do  we  find
studies that have focused on the learners’ task and person knowledge. Exceptions to the former
are  the  studies  by  Lavelle  (1993),  Victori  (1995);  Silva  and  Nicholls  (1993)  on  writing  skills;
Vogely  (1995)  on  listening  skills;  Kamhi-Stein  (2003)  and  Schoonen  et  al.  (1998)  on  reading,
and  Jimenez  (2003)  on  vocabulary  learning.    As  for  questionnaires  analyzing  Person
Knowledge,  most  tend  to  focus  on  learners’  interpersonal  factors  such  as  self-esteem,
motivation  and  attitudes  towards  language  learning  or  self-directed  learning  (Wong,1996;
Broady, 1996).

One may note, that with very few exceptions (Poppi, 2000; Sheerin, 1997; Press, 1996; Broady,
1996; Victori & Lockhart, 1995; Cotterall, 1999), most of the aforementioned instruments have
been  primarily  used  for  research  rather  than  for  pedagogical  purposes.  Yet,  most  of  the
implications  derived  in  those  studies  about  the  pros  and  cons  of  using  these  instruments  are
also  relevant  for  those  devised  for  learner  training  purposes.    Accordingly,  while  structured
instruments are clearly advantageous for collecting general beliefs of large groups of students,
these instruments present a number of disadvantages that should be considered as well. First
of all, they fail to provide an in-depth analysis of the beliefs elicited of learners. This limitation
may  not  be  relevant  for  certain  types  of  research  (e.g.,  when  the  objective  is  to  describe,
compare  or  contrast  beliefs  across  groups  of  students),  but  it  is  of  paramount  importance  for
counseling  purposes.    In  this  sense,  Victori’s    (1992)  instrument  is  a  welcome  contribution.
Albeit a structured instrument (with ranking, multiple-choice and Lickert-scale type of questions),
some of questions it contains are intended to elicit the rationale underlying many of the beliefs
reflected by some of the other items, hence allowing the learner to reflect on his MK and justify
his  or  her  answers.  This  questionnaire,  which  has  been  used  extensively  for  counseling
purposes, has proved to be quite useful in enhancing self-directed learners’ MK (see Victori &
Lockhart,  1995  for  a  full  account  of  its  use).    As  the  authors  put  it,  after  learners  answer  the
questionnaire, this is followed-up by an individual interview with the counselor who focuses on
those  beliefs  which  are  perceived  as  potentially  counterproductive  for  the  student’s  learning
approach.  Hence, the questionnaire is mainly used to trigger beliefs which are later developed,
contrasted or commented on in the interaction learners have with the counselors.

Another problem associated with structured instruments -aside from those listed in Table 2 - is
their  lack  of  specificity  and  contextualization,  as  most  of  the  questions  posed  do  not  refer  to
specific  learning  tasks  or  situations.  This  may  result  in  a  source  of  confusion  for  learners,  as
they  may  not  be  able  to  decide  the  particular  circumstances  under  which  certain  beliefs  are
held.  For  example,  in  eliciting  learner’s  strategic  knowledge,  learners  may  ‘overestimate  or

Documents de Recerca ª

 2004 Universitat de Vic

underestimate the frequency of use of certain strategies; they may be unaware of when they are
using a given strategy and even more important, how they are using it “ (Cohen, 1998: 30).  To
get around this problem, Cohen suggests asking learners about recent experiences and tasks,
or learning events, for example, administering the instrument right after undertaking a language
task, and then questioning about the specific task (see section 4.3).

A third problem associated with questionnaires, as well as other survey instruments, concerns
the focus and the  wording of the  questions  posed,  which  may  also  become  problematic.    MK
covers a broad spectrum of areas and angles, ranging from our  beliefs  about  universal  truths
and self-concept (PK), our knowledge of the general process and nature of language  learning
(TK) to our perceptions on the use and usefulness of certain strategies (SK) (Flavell, 1979).  It is
not surprising then, that such a variety of concepts has resulted in different ways of focusing the
questions,  and  brought  with  it  a  range  of  associated  problems.    Questions,  or  introductory
prompts, may ask students about their perceptions of the usefulness of certain strategies (as in
What  strategy  do  you  consider  most  useful),  their  preference  (as  in  What  strategy  do  you
prefer), and their actual usage1 (as in What do you do when you... for example, read a  text').
Prompts  may  also  vary  from  the  more  objective  (as  in  What  is  the  purpose  of  writing)  to  the
more subjective (as in What material do you prefer); they may use different tenses, varying from
simple present (as in What do you usually do, implying a customary habit), present perfect (as
in  What  has  helped  you  most)  where  the  emphasis  is  placed  on  the  respondent's  past
experience),  to  other  tenses  (as  in  What  would  you  do  if  you  had  to?,  intended  to  elicit  the
subjects' prediction of behavior).  Finally, different person forms may also be used ranging from
first person (as in the statement: I usually guess words from context, which questions the user’s
experience),  to  other  forms  (as  in  you  /  one  /  learners  should  always  ask  the  teacher,  which
represents  a  more  prescriptive  belief).  As  Victori  (1999a)  notes,  when  designing  the
questionnaire,  the  wording  and  focus  of  the  prompt  chosen  will  very  much  depend  on  the
research questions that we pursue. The different possible wordings specified before may all be
appropriate  in  a  particular  context  as  long  as  we  use  them  systematically,  and  avoid  subtly
varying  from  one  focus  to  another,  as  this  would  be  confusing  for  the  informant  (Tragant,
1992:108).

these 

instruments  are  not  without  disadvantages.  Apart 

Certainly, using semi-structured questionnaires allows for even more in-depth responses.  The
questions are less likely to lead the informants in their answers and these do not limit learners in
the answers they can choose from.  Wong (354) and Rivers (2001) are examples of two studies
that  have  used  semi-structured  questionnaires  for  eliciting  learners’  beliefs  for  SDL  purposes.
However, 
from  problems  of
understanding the students' handwriting and obtaining complete or not too sketchy answers, the
main  problem  in  collecting  data  on  MK  with  more  semi-structured  questionnaires  is  perhaps
obtaining  responses  that  are  relevant  to  the  researcher's  objectives  or  which  are  liable  to
interpretation. Research shows (Luppescu & Day, 1990; Flavell, 1979; Victori, 1995, 1999a) that
not all students have reflected  on their learning;  in fact, this may  be the  first  time  they  do  so,
which may result in too short and limited responses, irrelevant comments, or often, no answer at
all.    Furthermore,  in  an  attempt  to  make  questions  simple  and  short,  questionnaires  often
include  technical  terms,  such  as  'mental  process',  'planning  strategies',  'learning  task'  or
'learning process' or use  ambiguous or  unclear sentences that are open to a  large number of
                                                
(cid:20)(cid:3)3hrasing questions or statements in one way or another may result in different responses.  For
example, a pilot study  Victori (1995) conducted on students' MK on  writing strategies,  yielded
slightly  different  results  when  the  subjects  were  questioned  about  their  perception  of  the
usefulness of a given strategy than when they were asked about their actual use of the same
strategy.  The study showed low correlations between each matched pair of statements, ranging
from  .2  to  .4  in  most  of  the  cases,  with  some  exceptional  cases  correlating  above  .5.  The
discrepancies observed showed that what students perceived as useful (i.e., their preference),
did  not  always  match  what  they  reported  doing  (reported  use).  Sometimes,  the  mismatch
seemed  to  result  from  the  slight  difference  of  meaning  conveyed  by  using  an  impersonal
pronoun (we, students, etc.  in  version  C),  and  the  first  person  (I,  in  version  D),  or  by  using  a
prescriptive tone (e.g., we should write an outline, in version C) and a descriptive one ( I write
outlines, in version D).  This study indicated that, for research purposes, asking about 'what they
did'  (Version  D)  proved  to  be  more  insightful  than  when  questioning  about  their  perceived
usefulness (Version C).

interpretations. For instance,  asking students 'what strategies they prefer  to  use  when  writing'
may leave the informant in doubt as to what kind of writing; in what stage of the writing process;
and  in  what  situation  (whether  at  school  or  at  home)  the  question  refers  to.    Hence,  piloting
structured and semi-structured instruments before administering them is an important requisite
that should never be neglected, not even for pedagogical purposes.

4.2 Interviews

In  SDL  programs  informal  interviews  between  the  pedagogue  and  the  learner  constitute  the
most basic form of support provided for learner training2. These interview sessions, known as
counseling sessions, are undertaken to check student’s progress, provide them with feedback
on  their  productive  skills,  give  them  advice,  make  suggestions,  and  on  the  whole,  to  provide
them  with  the  methodological  and  psychological  support  needed  to  help  learners  direct  their
learning.  Because of the nature of the topics that are usually covered in those sessions, they
have  become  the  focus  of  much  recent  research,  which  has  started  to  analyze  through
discourse analysis (see Crabbe et al., 2001) and other qualitative procedures (see Pemberton &
Toogood,  2001)  the  kinds  of  attitudes,  expectations,  strategies  as  well  as  beliefs  and
misconceptions that learners disclose in those spontaneous interactions.

Among the major advantages of using interviews for learner training there is the possibility for
students to expand on their answers, providing a rationale for the beliefs expressed. They are
also  helpful  for  contextualizing  responses,  as  respondents  may  be  referred  to  specific  tasks,
contexts or situations rather than to general language learning situations.  Finally, they can also
be used  to  complement  data  elicited  with  more  structured  instruments  or  procedures,  or  as  a
unique data collection method. Certainly, the main problems with them are that they are time-
consuming  and  are  not  appropriate  for  large  groups  of  learners,  which  has  forced  learner
training  programs  to  think  of  alternative  ways  to  individual  counseling  sessions,  among  them,
group interviews.

Group  interviews  are  increasingly  becoming  an  important  part  of  many  SDL  classroom-based
(Vandergrift,  2002;  Pemberton  &  Toogood,  2001;  Nordlund,  2001)  and  resource-based
programs (for information in how to exploit their use, see Esch, 1997), which organize seminars,
workshops  or  group  tutorials  as  part  of  their  support  system.    Apart  from  being  more  cost-
effective  than  individual  interviews,  they  also  have  the  advantage  of  providing  a  fruitful
interaction among learners who find other students with similar problems, with whom they can
share their experience, or work on similar activities.   Yet,  they are not devoid  of  problems:  a)
firstly,  some  learners’  responses  may  be  affected  by  social  desirability,  that  is,  they  may  only
refer to beliefs that  are  socially  acceptable  and  not  what  they  really  think;  secondly,  as  some
subjects do not easily  volunteer answers, “the  information obtained may  be  biased in favor  of
students who are more outspoken” (Cohen, 1998:29).

One the first studies  documented  using interviews  as a pedagogical  instrument  for  enhancing
students’  awareness  about  L2  learning  was  Wenden  (1986)  who  used  semi-structured
interviews  with  25  adults  attending  language  classes  at  Columbia  University.  The  purpose  of
her  study  was  to  analyze  the  beliefs  students  held  concerning  how  best  to  learn  a  language,
and to see whether these beliefs were reflected in the learner's approach to language learning.
Likewise,  White  (1999)  designed  a  series  of  instruments,  among  them  naturalistic  interviews,
which  were  first  used  in  the  context  of  general  course  advice  to  elicit  a  group  of  prospective
distance  learners’  beliefs  about  their  expectations  and  previous  experience,  and  which  later
served to design other elicitation instruments - individual follow-up interviews, rating scales and
scenario  exercises.  Cabaroglu  and  Roberts  (2000)  also  used  interviews  to  check  the
development  of  beliefs  of  a  group  of  TESOL  students.  In  the  same  vein,  Pemberton  and
Toogood (2001) interviewed students enrolled in a self-directed learning programs to elicit their
beliefs  about  their  expectations  and  perceptions  of  the  advising  sessions  they  had  received.
                                                
(cid:21)(cid:3) While  informal  interviews  have  become  a  general  practice  in  many  SDL  programs,  fewer
studies  provide  evidence  of  the  use  of  more formal  or  standardized  interviews,  other  than  for
research  purposes  (see  Zimmerman  &  Martinez-Pons,  1986;  Purdie  &  Oliver,  1999;  Yongqi,
2003, for some illustrations).

These data  was complemented with  that  obtained  with  questionnaires,  diaries,  written  reports
and recordings of advising sessions.  Similar examples we find them in Wong (1996), who used
semi-structured  interviews  along  with  questionnaires  and  teachers’  observations  of  SDL
learners  working  in  SACs,  and  Barcelos  (1999)  who  adopted  an  ethnographic  approach  to
examine learners’ beliefs, consisting of open-ended questionnaires, semi-structured interviews,
classroom observation notes and diary writing.

4.3 Raise–awareness tasks

to  using 

Using  learning  tasks  as  a  means  of  triggering  learners’  reflection  on  their  language  learning
procedures  has  a  number  of  advantages  compared 
interviews  and  written
questionnaires alone. They allow learners to focus on particular tasks and settings3, which help
them conceptualize their beliefs and thoughts, and as tasks are undertaken prior to reflecting,
problems of memory are thus avoided. Because of these advantages, learning tasks have been
extensively used for research purposes along with other introspective procedures such as think-
aloud  -in which learners are asked to verbalize their thoughts- and retrospective ones, such as
stimulated recall  or post-hoc interviews,  in  which  excerpts  of  video  or  tape  recorded  sessions
are used to stimulate the learner’s memory of the task undertaken. By using these procedures
researchers can not only trace the learner’s thinking processes but they can also relate them to
the behaviors observed.

Other than for research purposes, using raise-awareness tasks have proved to be an effective
means  of  eliciting  learners’  awareness  about  their  own  learning.  As  a  matter  of  fact,  having
learners  experiment  with  learning  tasks  lies  at  the  heart  of  many  strategic  training  programs
today.    According  to  Holec  (1981)  learner  training,  or  learner  development,  as  he  and  other
authors  have  called  it,  should  be  enhanced  by  having  learners  experiment  with  language
learning  so  that  they  discovered  by  trial-and-error  the  knowledge  and  techniques  which  they
need.

One of the pioneer examples in the use of raise-awareness tasks for pedagogical purposes is
Ellis  and  Sinclair’s    (1989)  widely  used  textbook    ‘Learning  to  learn  English,’  whose  main
objective was to enhance the learner’s reflection and his development as autonomous learners
through  the  use  of  self-awareness  tasks,  such  as  memorizing  lists  of  vocabulary,  guessing
words from a reading passage, deducing the grammatical rules out of a sample or note-taking.
These activities are either preceded or followed by questions that ask students to reflect on the
procedures used when undertaking the task.  Ma (1994),  Villanueva et al. (1997), and Nordlund
(2001)  also  used  problem-solving  and  language  learning  tasks  to  encourage  the  learners’
reflection  in  language  learning  and  to  increase  their  repertoire  of  strategies,  as  part  of  the
induction sessions offered in their learner-training programs.  Similarly, Vandergrift (2002) used
a number of language learning activities and retrospective tasks to elicit students’ person, task
and strategic knowledge on listening skills.

A useful instrument that is typically used in SDL programs to enhance students’ awareness on
the learning activities they undertake is the students’ log. In this form, students are encouraged
to write down not only the activities they carry out, but to include other relevant comments such
as difficulties encountered, methodological problems as well  as any  other  positive or  negative
attitudes that arise as they go along their learning process. These logs are often checked out by
the counselor or teacher and, therefore, besides being a useful instrument for self-assessment,
they  constitute  an  important  source  for  eliciting  learner’s  beliefs,  and  misconceptions.  Some
illustrations on the use of students' log can be found in Martyn (1994), Rivers (2001) and Fowler
(1997).

Finally,  a  good  way  of  raising  awareness  while  learners  use  learning  tasks  is  outlined  in
Nunan’s  article  (1997)  which  presents  a  scheme  of  five  levels  for  gradually  increasing  the
degree  of  autonomy  of  learners  through  the  use  of  conventional  –and  later  newly  created-
                                                
3      If  the  objective,  however,  is  to  elicit  the  typical  strategies  used  more  generally,  these
activities are then not useful (Chaudron, 2003:11. Fig. 4).

pedagogical  materials.    Though  several  examples,  Nunan  shows  how  learners  can  be  made
aware of the pedagogical goals, contents, strategy implications of commercial learning activities
and suggests ways for teachers to adapt and modify materials in ways which are more likely to
enhance learner autonomy.  According to Nunan (1997), in undertaking the activities suggested
either individually or in group work and group discussions, students’ degree of learner autonomy
is thus enhanced.

4.4 Using indirect instruments

Some studies have reported the use of more indirect means of data collection procedures, such
as  case  studies,  pictures,  texts  or  video  excerpts,  which  portray  different  learner  profiles  or
learning  situations,  in  order  to  enhance  students’  metacognitive  awareness.  Accordingly,
learners  are  encouraged  to  discuss  and  share  their  views  about  the  situation  which  is  being
reflected in the prompt, and in so doing, they are helped to explicitly articulate their own beliefs
about  several  aspects  of  language  learning.  External  prompts  are  thus  used  as  a  form  of
eliciting hidden assumptions that would be otherwise more difficult to elicit. Because of this, they
have been frequently used with children, although we also find examples of use with more adult
learners.

In  Wenden’s  (1991)  book  we  find  a  number  of  case  studies  of  language  learners  which  are
followed by questions intended to enhance the reader’s reflection about his own use of learning
strategies, and beliefs about SLA.  A similar example we find it in Ma (1994) and Villanueva et
al. (1999) who used simulations of case studies to elicit beliefs about students' own experiences
in language learning as part of a learner training program.  Along the same lines, White (1999)
used  verbatim  extracts  obtained  from  prior  interviews,  reports  and  other  open-ended
instruments to design a number of learner profiles which formed the basis of scenario exercises.
These  profiles  were  then  shown  to  students  who  had  to  select  the  one  which  most  closely
reflected their own view and experience of distance language learning.

In the general field of education we find numerous studies that have used visual prompts such
as pictures or video excerpts to elicit students’ beliefs about learning. Berry and Schlberg (1996)
used  what  they  called  a  ‘metaphor  task’,  which  consisted  of  four  pictures  illustrating  different
types of learning. These were used along with other data collection methods, namely, a Lickert-
scale  questionnaire  and  a  open-ended  writing  task  intended  to  elicit  additional  information  on
students’ beliefs.

Using metaphors, either of a visual or a written type, can be considered another  indirect way of
tapping students’ belief systems.  Metaphors tend to express multiple meanings and in recent
years the number of studies analyzing learners’ use of metaphors about learning and teaching
has increased considerably (Block, 1990; Ellis, 1999). This approach, based on the pioneering
work that Lakoff and Johnson did in the 1980s, lies on the premise that  “ individuals frame and
express their experience on the basis of largely unconscious conceptual metaphors” (In Riley,
1996:161);  therefore,  metaphors  allow  learners  to  “verbalize  what  is  unknown  or  difficult  to
describe in other terms (Cortazzi & Jin, 1996, cited in Riley, 1996: 161), and to “organize their
beliefs and experience and to make them explicit” (Riley, 1996: 162).

In  sum,  using  these  indirect  prompts  seems  a  promising  way  of  stimulating  students’  MK,  as
they allow to capture unconscious assumptions that may be more difficult to trace through direct
procedures.

4.5 Diaries

Diaries are typically used by SLA researchers to investigate different aspects of T-S interaction,
the  learner’s  language  acquisition  process,  attitudes,  strategies,  motivation,  problems,  etc.  By
their  very introspective nature, they are also a rich source for eliciting students’ MK about their
own language learning.

Documents de Recerca ª

 2004 Universitat de Vic

13

Compared to other instruments, they present a number of advantages both for the students and
for  the  pedagogue.  For  the  learners,  diaries  can  enhance  their  reflection  about  their  own
learning process as well as their capacity to articulate the problems they have. If used regularly,
they  can  help  L2  learners  improve  their  literacy  skills  as  well  writing  fluency  as  they  learn  to
express  themselves  personally  without  the  pressures  they  feel  during  class  activities  or  with
more  academic  writing  tasks.  Finally,  diaries  can  enhance  students’  autonomous  learning,  as
they are encouraged to take responsibility for their learning. Nevertheless, for these advantages
to be fully effective, diary and journals need to be analyzed; simply writing diary entries does not
ensure  all  of  the  potential  benefits;  entries  need  to  be  reread  and  emerging  patterns  found
(Bailey, 1990). For this reason, sharing the  learner’s entries  with the teacher or the counselor
may prove to be even more beneficial for learners, especially for learner training purposes, as
these  can  help  them  interpret  their  own  feedback  and  take  decisions  about  their  learning  by
writing comments, supportive and sympathetic feedback, and/or advice on students’ entries.

From  the  pedagogues'  point  of  view,  students'  diaries  also  present  a  number  of  advantages.
They can enhance teacher-student interaction beyond the classroom or program, and usually a
friendlier  relationship  between  them;  they  provide  pedagogues  with  feedback  about  their
learners' particular learning experiences, and if entries are collected regularly, they can provide
a  continuous  record  of  students’  development. 
teacher’s
understanding of individual students (e.g., their interests, their attitudes, or their problems inside
and outside of school), diaries are particularly useful for individualized instruction, and in turn,
for  SDL programs.

they  enhance 

In  sum,  as 

Among the problems associated with diaries, we need to refer to three of them: first, they  are
burdensome  and  a  fatiguing  process  which  requires  time  and  dedication;  second,  not  all
students are committed to the task in the same way, thus, unless regularly asked to write, some
learners  eventually  loose  interest  and  stop  writing  them;  and  third,  some  students  may  feel
reluctant  to  express  themselves  openly  and  hence,  they  should  be  allowed  enough  time  to
develop confidence in using this instrument.

Among  the  few  studies  that  have  used  diaries  with  self-directed  learners  we  should  mention
Rosewell and Libben (1994),  who used these  instruments to identify the self-directed learning
behaviors,  or  ‘autonomously-controlled  tasks”  that  learners  engaged  in,  which  served  as  a
means to affect their subsequent learning.  Pang’s study (1994) is also worth mentioning as he
gave  learners  the  option  of  recording  their  entries  in  tapes  instead  of  writing  them  on  paper;
Fitzgerald et al. (1996) and Oxbrow (1999) used learner diaries along with other procedures as
part of the induction session to a SDL program.  In a similar vein, Lor (1998- cited in Benson,
2001)  used  reflection  journals  as  a  means  of  encouraging  learners  reflect  on  their  learning
experiences.  Without  imposing  any  kind  of  restriction  on  them,  a  number  of  areas  where
subsequently identified: learning events, the learner’s role in the learning process, the learners’
feelings, gains, difficulties encountered and decisions and plans.  He concluded, however, that
the  students  had  found  the  process  of  reflection  difficult,  as  they  often  felt  unsure  as  to  what
“they  should  write  and  looked  to  her  for  guidance”  (Lor,  cited  in  Benson,  2001;  p.  207).  The
author  observed  that  there  were  few  instances  of  deep  reflection,  that  rarely  did  those
reflections lead to changes in plan, that there was little sense of continuity across entries, that
there  was  clear  changes  of  perceptions  as  a  result  of  reworking  experiences,  and  concluded
that teachers should “ aim to provide students with challenging experiences that provoke deeper
reflection and with opportunities to discuss the processes of learning that arise from them” (p.
207).

Lor's  study  has  important  implications  for  learner  training  purposes.  While  it  has  been  often
recommended  for  teachers  not  to  encourage  highly  structured,  or  focused  diary  prompts  --so
that students can comment freely on what they consider to be important, feel motivated by this
task, and do not perceive it as an obligatory assignment (Genesse and Upshure, 1996)-- it also
appears  that  placing  some  kind  of  restriction  and  suggesting  some  specific  questions  or
challenging tasks to learners may be more desirable to help them focus in specific ways.

4.6 Autobiographies

Autobiographies  share  with  diaries  their  retrospective  perspective  and  the  fact  that  they  are
open-ended  in  nature.    In  an  autobiography,  however,  learners  are  asked  to  describe  and
evaluate positive and negative aspects of their past learning experience, hence providing useful
‘baseline’ for each learner (Kasper, 1997:3).  Because of this, they are a useful data collection
means of eliciting learners’ MK as well.

A  good  illustration  of  this  use,  we  find  it  in  Carter’s  (2001)  study  which  he  undertook  with  a
group of advanced foreign language learners who were asked to submit their autobiographies,
that is, their ‘personal L2 learning history” as part of their learner autonomy project. This report,
which was the first entry they wrote in their diaries, was intended to reflect their first exposure to
language  learning,  including  their  experience  at  school  and  with  their  previous  language
teachers.  According to the author, this first entry clearly provided differentiated data compared
to  the  subsequent  entries  that  were  recorded  in  the  students’  diaries  and  served  a  different
function.  Whereas  the  diaries  reflected  students’  daily  difficulties  and  challenges  with  their
language  learning  process,  the  autobiography  “provided  a  rationale  for  the  kind  of  language
learners  they  were”    (p.30)  and  “presented  the  framework  of  their  language  learning  with
highlights of the significant events in their language career” (p.22).  Other studies that have also
used  autobiographies  are  the  ones  undertaken  by  Kasper  (1997),  who  analyzed  learners’
conceptions  of  writing;  Cabaroglu  and  Roberts  (2000),  who  used  autobiographies  to  analyze
TESOL students’ beliefs about language learning and teaching; and Tse (2000) whose learners
were  given  10  open-ended  questions  to  reflect  about  their  foreign  language  study  history,
experience and views.

5. CONCLUSIONS   

Enhancing  students’  MK  is  fundamental  for  helping  self-directed  learning  students  exert  more
control and responsibility over their learning approach. A review of the literature has suggested
a number of ways to do so, each  of  them  presenting  its  own  advantages  and  disadvantages.
What  follows  are  some  general  guidelines  one  should  consider  for  eliciting  data  on  students’
MK.

The decision of choosing between structured or unstructured instruments will very much depend
on the amount and type of data one intends to collect. If the purpose is to obtain qualitative and
lengthy  information  about  learners'  beliefs,  then  using  semi-open  instruments,  such  as  formal
and  informal  interviews,  autobiographies,  students’  logs  or  diaries  with  specific  suggestions,
seem to me the most appropriate procedure, even better than using too open instruments which
often result in too unmanageable and irrelevant data. If the objective is to obtain typical learners’
beliefs  from  large  groups  of  learners  then  using  structured  instruments,  such  as  written
questionnaires,  seem  more  adequate.  In  either  case,  to  override  some  of  the  problems
associated  with  these  types  of  instruments,  and  to  maximize  their  benefits,  the  following
recommendations should be considered.

When framing the question, we should: a) avoid asking about too general situations and instead
we should accompany the prompt with a specific context or situation (e.g., writing a descriptive
essay at school); b) we should avoid the use of different types of probing questions as well as
moving back and forth from absolute judgments to more relative judgments, or varying temporal
or  personal  references  that  might  confuse  the  reader;  c)  statements  or  questions  should  be
clear, limited to one single possible interpretation and lay terms used in their  wording. Finally,
asking learners about what they do rather than about their perceived usefulness seems a more
reliable measure as well.

In order to facilitate students’ awareness of what they actually do, learners should be asked to
undertake  a  learning  task  before  asking  them  to  reflect  though  elicitation  instruments.  To  this

end,  using  raise-awareness  learning  tasks  as  well  as  other  indirect  prompts,  such  as
simulations, metaphors or video excerpts of learner profiles may be quite useful.

Likewise,  in  order  to  override  the  problems  associated  with  each  type  of  instruments,  and  to
complement data, we should ideally combine structured elicitation procedures with more open-
ended ones, for example, combining written questionnaires with oral interviews or diary entries.

We  should  be  wary  of  using  beliefs  alone  as  indicators  of  future  behavior,  as  there  are  a
number of factors that may account for the discrepancies found  between the learner's reports
and behavior. Only by comparing elicited beliefs with observation or some forms of introspection
of  learners'  behavior,  such  as  with  think-aloud,  can  we  gain  some  knowledge  of  their  actual
behavior and assess the influence of both positive or counterproductive beliefs into the students'
learning approach.

Finally,  for  counseling  purposes,  elicitation  procedures,  especially  if  these  are  structured,
should be accompanied by some form of follow-up discussion or post-hoc interview which would
allow learners to contrast their beliefs and possible misconceptions with those of the counselor
or  their  peers.  Alternatively,  students  can  be  also  encouraged  to  read  texts  on  language
learning topics, which would be useful in illuminating their knowledge as well. Otherwise, using
elicitation  procedures  without  any  kind  of  follow-up  from  the  pedagogue  may  be  altogether  of
little us.
