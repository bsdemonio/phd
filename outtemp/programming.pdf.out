At Ramapo College of New Jersey, intelligent tutors, called problets, are being developed
for programming concepts. We want to integrate concept maps into these tutors. They will be
used for discovery learning, active learning, navigation, problem selection and to open the student
model.
Discovery Learning: In problets, students explore a concept map that has already been built for
them. They click on a leaf node to expand its children (if any) or click on an intermediate node
to  collapse  its  subtree.  Initially  the  tree  can  be
displayed to any depth. 
Active Learning: In problets, we plan to have the
user build their own concept maps. Currently we
provide the students with a list of concepts (in the
form of nodes) and have them connect the nodes,
thus  creating  the  relationships  between  the
concepts.  These  features  should  improve  the
studentâ€™s  structural  knowledge.  We  plan  to  test
this hypothesis.
Navigation:  Concept  maps  can  help  with
navigation in the tutor by allowing the user to go
from  a  node  in  the  tree  directly  to  the  concept
he/she wants to review. They can direct the user to a section where he/she can read about the
specific concept, practice solving problems or get tested.
Open Student Model: Concept maps can also be used to open the student model to inspection.
In the concept map, each node is shaded proportional to the level of proficiency of the student on
the concept. For example, if the student is working on loops consisting of for, while and do loops,
as soon as he/she has finished for loops the loops node is shaded 33%.
Problem Selection: Concept maps can be used to let the user choose the concept on which to
solve the next problem. Since each node represents a concept, the student can clearly see the
concepts that need additional practice and click on the corresponding nodes. The student is not
done until all the concepts are learned, i.e., all the nodes are shaded a minimum of say, 70%. Will
giving the student the power to select the next problem rather than deciding it for him/her help
improve learning or the pace of learning?
